Coursera Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods
## 1. Introduction
As a part of the final IBM Capstone Project, we get a feel of what data scientists go through in real life. Objectives of the final assignments were to define a business problem, look for data in the web and, use Foursquare location data to solve or execute the problem.
### Problem Statement : 
### Background
I love to travel. However, travelling to another country requires so much planning. There are hundreds, or even thousands of different sites that I can do my research on to know about the most worth it accommodations, the must try food and sightseeing places. If I want to find out about all these places, well, I will at least need months of preparation. However, with my mind all occupied on where to go, I might just miss out on one of the most important information. 

How prepared must I be in a foreign country? These tourist areas might be surrounded with crime such as muggings, thefts or even assault. Going to these tourist venues might put my life in danger instead.
### Target Audience
The target audience for this solution would be travellers who wants to stay safe while having fun travelling in the country. Or even for people who are moving to that new neighbourhood and wants to know the vicinity a little better, to be prepared. 
## 2. Data 
### Data Description
In this section I will describe the data that is going to be used to solve the problem. I would be using Toronto, Canada as the example of the foreign country these target audience would be going. They would be travelling to popular sites and restaurants.
The following data would be what I am going to use:
1.	Query the Foursquare website for the top sites in Toronto
2.	Use the Foursquare API to get geographical data on the top sites
3.	User Foursquare API to get top restaurant data nearest to the top sites.
4.	Use Toronto Police Service Public Safety Data Portal to get crime data
